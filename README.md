# Deep Learning Based Fish Breed Classification

Fish breed classification using machine learning is a powerful tool that can help you identify different species of fish. This readme file will provide an overview of the steps involved in setting up and running a machine learning model to accurately classify fish breeds. We will discuss the data sources, preprocessing techniques, model selection, and evaluation metrics to be used for the task.


## Objectives

The major objective of our project is to determine the specific breed of fish using deep learning. 

To Use the knowledge of deep learning to distinguish breeds of fish

Collect datasets required for developing and testing our model that is to be built.

Build a model to classify fish breeds using image processing and machine learning with the help of certain tools and python language plus its libraries.

Check, compare and analyze the output of our project.

## Methodology

A deep study of multiple fish breeds. 

Analysis and classification of fish breeds to determine the correct species of fish. 

Selection of dataset including numerous images of fishes.
Loading of data.

Pre-processing of data.

To implement this model , python will be used along with machine learning algorithms.

Training of the model.

Testing and improvisation of the model.

## Tools and technologies

Kaggle : Kaggle is a website for sharing ideas, getting inspired, competing against other data scientists, learning new information and coding tricks, as well as seeing various examples of real-world data science applications.

Python 3 : Libraries like NumPy, and matplotlib make it very capable of processing, manipulating, and visualizing data — which is why it’s favored in data analysis. 

Code editor : VS Code/google colab.
